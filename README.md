# Text Detection with EasyOCR and OpenCV

This project demonstrates how to use EasyOCR and OpenCV to detect and annotate text in images. The code reads an image, uses EasyOCR to detect text, and then uses OpenCV to annotate the detected text on the image.


## Introduction
This project showcases a simple implementation of text detection in images using EasyOCR and OpenCV. The script reads an image, detects text, and annotates the text with bounding boxes and text labels.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to install the following dependencies:
- OpenCV
- EasyOCR
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using pip:

pip install opencv-python easyocr matplotlib



Usage:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/deniz2144/text-detection.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd text-detection


Run the script:

python text_detection.py
